            <li>The Queen of <b>The British Lostbelt</b>  (ブリテン異聞帯, Buriten Ibuntai?), designated Order Lostbelt No. 6 (ロストベルト No. 6?), is one of the seven Lostbelts appearing on the blankened Earth during the Human Order Revision incident. Originating in 12,000 BC (originally listed as 500 AD), its Lost Depth is EX, its King is Morgan, and its associated Crypter is Beryl Gut. It is the sixth of the Lostbelts visited by Chaldea Security Organization in the undertaking of the Grand Order to restore Earth and the Human Order. Referred to as the English Lostbelt (イギリス異聞帯, Igirisu Ibuntai?) by outsiders, the inhabitants call it the British Lostbelt and Faerie Britain (妖精國ブリテン, Yōseikoku Buriten?). As of Chaldea's arrival, the form of the world is that of a Lost World rather than a Lostbelt.</li>

            <b>Fae Round Table Domain: Avalon le Fae</b>
        </p>

        <ul class="points">
            <li><b>Setting:</b> Time flows differently inside the Lostbelt than outside. At the Wandering Sea, Chaldea is warned that they only have 24 hours before the Lostbelt self-destructs and takes the outside world with it,[3] but once inside the Lostbelt, the crew exhausts 50 days' worth of supplies before the mission is over.</li>
            <li><b>The Lostbelt:</b> has existed for 14,000 years.The Lostbelt's true divergence point from Proper History was the absence of Excalibur, leaving Earth with no way to properly defend itself from Sefar.</li>
            <li><b>Six fairies:</b> (who would later become the founders of the fairy clans) were tasked with forging the Holy Sword, but chose not to out of sheer laziness. This resulted in Sefar succeeding in the Velber's goals by wiping out all life and landmasses of the planet with the exception of Avalon, which the fairies could never return to as "only those free of sin may pass", leaving them to buffeted by the endless ocean's giant waves. Eventually, Gaia sent Cernunnos from the Inner Sea of the Planet to properly punish their failure, but it felt the fairies had already suffered enough. Instead, it allowed them to live upon its body alongside the last surviving human, who Cernunnos had taken as a wife and priestess.</li>
            <li><b>Cernunnos:</b>  to create a new home for them, something it could not do. The Priestess chastised them to reflect on their actions. Instead, the Fairies concluded that Cernunnos’ titanic body would make a nice landmass to live on. They held a celebratory feast and lied to Cernunnos about wanting to become its worshipers and offered it drink. Cernunnos, believing the fairies had finally repented, gladly accepted the offering despite its priestess's disbelief and suspicion. She was correct; Cernunnos was killed by the poison in the drink, and the fairies fashioned its corpse into a new Britain.</li>
            <li><b>The fairies:</b> proceeded to create a false legend about Britain's creation for their later subjects to hide the truth. In their story, there were only six fairies and an endless ocean in the beginning. Cernunnos emerged from the ocean alongside a squirrel-like animal sitting on its shoulder that was presumed extinct. The fairies desired land, but Cernunnos, being a god, demanded sacrifices, so the fairies offered their joys and their wills to the horned god. Granting the wish, the god brought the land that would be known as Britain and once finished, he succumbed to slumber. For over 10,000 years, the fairy clans believed this lie until Morgan, who upon becoming queen discovered the truth and proceeded to remove Cernunnos from all records, resulting in the Lostbelt residents forgetting the concepts of gods and priests over the course of 2000 years.</li>
            <li><b>Previous Lostbelts:</b> could still be called "human history", the world of the English Lostbelt is a "fairy history" where fairies have dominated for thousands of years. Furthermore, the only landmass in the entire world is the island of Great Britain, while the rest of the planet is just an ocean. The concept of other countries does not exist.</li>
            <li><b>EX-Rank Lost Depth:</b> is not only due to Sefar wiping out all life on Earth, but because there was no life at all when the Lostbelt was intially founded. Indeed, when Beryl first arrived, the Lostbelt was a barren and lifeless land, as the Fae had long since betrayed each other and driven themselves to extinction due to their innocently capricious and merciless nature; to fufill their personal enjoyment and purpose, and get rid of anything in the way. However, Beryl would summon the Pan-Human Morgan as his Servant, who would then, without his knowledge, use the power of the dying Fantasy Tree to send her knowledge of Proper Human History and the future of the Lostbelt to her Lostbelt's past self (Aesc) via rayshifting, allowing the Lostbelt's past to be changed into what it is currently.</li>
            <li><b>Pop Culture Appearance:</b> The Diablo made appearances in popular culture, including movies like "Batman & Robin" and the TV series "Pacific Blue."</li>
            <li><b>Human civilization:</b> he 'modern' humans who exist are livestock used to perpetuate Fairy pleasure and are not 'born'. They are created by a method of cloning the body parts of the last remaining human; Cernunnos's priestress who had been torn apart and kept alive for 14,000 years by the founders of the Fairy Clans. The Fae instead mimic human civilization from Proper Human History via knowledge gained from Morgan, though they have no real understanding of culture or its significance. Da Vinci has stated that this world, rather than being an offshoot timeline, has completely veered off to the point that it can no longer be considered a Lostbelt but a completely new world truly separate from theirs.</li>
            <li><b>Morgan:</b> has ruled with an iron fist for 2,000 years. She conquered Britain by defeating the six fairy clans with her black magic, uniting them by force. She granted the humans a certain degree of freedom, and over the course of 2,000 years, she created a Fairy Kingdom that was a shallow copy of human civilization. When Morgan took to the throne, she said to the fairies: "I will not tolerate you. I will not save you. Merely obey. Hang your heads. I will protect a Britain of absolute subservience."</li>
            <p>It has been known to happen that objects, fairies, and humans find their way into the Lostbelt from other worlds, washing ashore as flotsam. They are known as Changelings.</p>
